# How to Import This Presentation into Gamma

## Quick Steps

1. **Go to Gamma.app** and sign in or create an account

2. **Create New Presentation**
   - Click "New" → "Presentation"
   - Or use the AI generator option

3. **Import the Content**
   - Option A: Copy the content from `GAMMA_PITCH_OPTIMIZED.md` and paste it into Gamma's text input
   - Option B: Use Gamma's import feature to upload the markdown file
   - Option C: Use Gamma's AI generator and paste the content as a prompt

4. **Gamma Will Automatically:**
   - Convert each section (separated by `---`) into individual cards/slides
   - Apply appropriate styling and layouts
   - Generate visual elements

5. **Customize:**
   - Adjust colors and themes to match your brand
   - Add images or logos
   - Modify layouts using Gamma's design tools
   - Add animations and transitions

## Tips for Best Results

- **Use `GAMMA_PITCH_OPTIMIZED.md`** - This version has clearer card breaks
- Each `---` separator creates a new slide/card
- Headings (`#`) create title cards
- Bullet points work well for content cards
- Gamma's AI will enhance the presentation automatically

## Recommended Customizations

1. **Add Your Logo** - Upload Edulink/UTP logos
2. **Color Scheme** - Use UTP brand colors (if applicable)
3. **Images** - Add screenshots of the application
4. **Animations** - Use Gamma's built-in animations for emphasis
5. **Speaker Notes** - Add notes for each slide

## Alternative: Direct Text Input

If importing doesn't work perfectly, you can:
1. Copy sections one by one
2. Use Gamma's `/split` command to create new cards
3. Use Gamma's AI enhancement feature to improve each card
