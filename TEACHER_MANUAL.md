# EduLink BErCHAMPION — Teacher User Manual

This manual explains how teachers use **EduLink** to identify students via camera scan and record **discipline/misconduct** entries, plus manage student profiles and print reports.

---

## 1) What you need (before you start)

- **A teacher account** (email + password) created by your school/admin.
- **A device with a camera**:
  - Phone/tablet recommended for scanning (back camera works best).
  - Laptop webcam also works.
- **Modern browser**: Chrome / Edge / Safari (latest versions recommended).
- **Good lighting** for face recognition (avoid backlight).

---

## 2) Logging in

1. Open EduLink in your browser.
2. On the **Login** page, enter:
   - **Email Address**
   - **Password**
3. Click **Sign In**.

If you’re unsure which email is registered, use **“Forgot your email? Find it here”** on the login page.

**After login**, you’ll be taken to the **Dashboard**.

---

## 3) Main navigation (what each menu does)

You can access these from the sidebar/menu:

- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Overview analytics (school-wide).
- **Scan Student** (`/scan`): Use camera to identify student and **record misconduct**.
- **Students** (`/students`): Search/filter students, open profiles, **add student**, and **print report**.
- **Forms** (`/forms`): Misconduct distribution and stats by **Form**; can print report.
- **Classes** (`/classes`): Misconduct stats by class (similar idea to Forms).
- **Profile** (`/profile`): View your profile details.
- **Logout**: Sign out safely.

> Admin users may also see **Admin Panel** and **Manage Teachers**.

## 4) Daily workflow (recommended)

### A) Scan a student and record misconduct (fastest method)

1. Go to **Scan Student**.
2. Aim the camera so the student’s face fits inside the **oval guide**.
3. Ensure:
   - face is clear (no mask/hand covering)
   - lighting is bright and even
   - only one face is in the frame
4. Tap **Capture Photo**.
5. Wait for identification:
   - If matched, you’ll see **Student Identified** + a **match %**.
   - If not matched, you’ll see **Student Not Found**.
6. Under **Record Misconduct**:
   - Choose **Misconduct Severity**: **Light** or **Medium**
   - Choose **Type of Misconduct** (dropdown changes based on severity)
   - (Optional) add **Additional Notes**
7. Click **Record Misconduct**.
8. The app will automatically open the student’s profile page.

**Screenshot placeholder:** `Scan Student` page + “Student Identified” result card.

---

### B) If the student is NOT found

You’ll see **Student Not Found** after capture.

Try these fixes first:

- Retake photo with **better lighting**
- Use the **back camera** (tap the camera rotate button)
- Move closer; keep face centered inside the oval
- Ensure the student has a registered face (see Section 6)

If the student is new or has no registered face:

- Go to **Students → Add Student** and register them (Section 6).

---

## 5) Finding a student (without scanning)

1. Go to **Students**.
2. Use the search box:
   - search by **name** or **student ID**
3. Use filters:
   - **Class** dropdown
   - **Form** dropdown
4. Click a student row to open the profile.

### Printing a students report

On the **Students** page, click **Print Report**.

Tip: For best printing results, use Chrome/Edge and enable **Background graphics** in print settings (optional).

---

## 6) Registering a new student (with face photo)

1. Go to **Students**.
2. Click **Add Student**.
3. Fill in **Basic Information** (required):
   - **Student ID**
   - **Full Name**
   - **Class**
   - **Form**
4. (Optional but recommended) Under **Face Registration**:
   - Click **Click to capture face photo**
   - Position the student’s face in the guide
   - Tap **Capture**
5. Click **Create Student**.

After creation, you’ll be taken to the student profile.

**Best practice for face capture**

- Bright, even lighting; avoid strong shadows
- Student looks straight at camera (neutral expression)
- No obstructions (cap, mask, hand, heavy glare)
- Only one face in frame

---

## 7) Viewing a student profile (and history)

Open a profile from **Students** list or after a successful scan.

On the student profile you can see:

- Student name, ID, class, form
- Whether **Face registered** / **No face registered**
- Misconduct totals and monthly counts (light/medium)
- **Discipline History** list showing:
  - severity (light/medium)
  - type
  - notes (if any)
  - recorded by (teacher name) + date/time

### Printing an individual student report

On the student profile page, click **Print Report**.

---

## 8) Editing a student (including updating the face)

1. Open the student profile.
2. Click **Edit Student**.
3. Update any basic details.
4. To update face registration:
   - In **Face Registration**, click to capture a **new** face photo
   - Capture and confirm
5. Click **Save Changes**.

---

## 9) Deleting a student (use with caution)

1. Open the student profile.
2. Click **Delete**.
3. Confirm deletion.

**Warning:** Deleting a student also deletes their discipline records and cannot be undone.

---

## 10) Forms & Classes dashboards (analytics + reports)

### Forms Overview

1. Go to **Forms**.
2. Review distribution charts and per-form stats.
3. Click a **Form card** to expand and view students in that form.
4. Use **Print Report** to print the forms distribution report.

### Classes

---

## 11) Profile & logout

- Go to **Profile** to view your account information.
- Use **Logout** from the sidebar/menu to end your session (recommended on shared devices).

---

## 12) Troubleshooting (common teacher issues)

### Camera doesn’t open / black screen

- Allow camera permission in your browser (site settings).
- Close other apps using the camera (WhatsApp/Teams/Zoom).
- On iPhone/iPad: camera access requires **HTTPS** in many cases (ask admin if you’re using a secure URL).

### “Student Not Found” too often

- Improve lighting; avoid backlight (window behind student).
- Move closer; keep face centered; avoid motion blur.
- Ensure the student’s face was captured during registration.
- If needed, update the student’s face photo (Section 8).

### Slow scan or timeout

- Network may be slow; try again.
- Reduce glare/blur so recognition completes faster.

---

## 13) Good practice & privacy reminders

- Only use EduLink for official school discipline purposes.
- Capture faces in a respectful, transparent manner.
- Avoid scanning groups; scan one student at a time.
- Always **logout** on shared devices.
